## RailTime: Privacy policy

Welcome to the RailTime app for Android!

This is an android app developed by Lucas Miserez. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. The only data that gets saved, are your settings. These are only available on your device and don't get send to anyone/anywhere.

If you got any further questions, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Lucas Miserez.
